## Workflow Overview

**Purpose:** Setting up a new brand from scratch with guidelines, assets, and strategy

**Target Users:**
- Business owners (need guidance)
- Consultants/Agencies (need standardization)
- In-house marketers (need validation)

**Key Features:**
- Three user modes: Guided, Express, Hybrid
- Mode-adaptive behavior throughout
- Spiral workflow model with validation loop-back
- Multi-format output generation (4 deliverables)
- Continuation support for multi-session workflows
- Brand Health Check (optional)
- Template loading (optional)

## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Workflow

1. **Navigate to your marketing-agent-team module directory**
2. **Invoke the workflow** using your BMAD system's workflow invocation
3. **Select your mode:**
   - **Guided Mode** - For beginners, step-by-step with explanations
   - **Express Mode** - For experts, streamlined with skip-ahead options
   - **Hybrid Mode** - For existing brands, validate and fill gaps

### What You'll Need

**Must-Have Inputs:**
- Company/brand name
- Industry or business type
- Mission statement or business purpose
- Basic products/services description

**Nice-to-Have Inputs:**
- Existing brand ideas or references
- Competitor brands they admire
- Target market description
- Any existing brand assets

### What You'll Get

**4 Output Format Files:**
1. **Full Brand Profile** - Comprehensive reference document
2. **One-Page Brand Summary** - Quick reference, single page
3. **Stakeholder Presentation Deck** - Buy-in and presentation
4. **Design Asset Brief** - Designer specifications

All outputs are generated in Markdown format.

## Usage Tips

### For Business Owners (Guided Mode)
- Take your time through each step
- Use the Brainstorming tool when stuck on values or mission
- Ask for examples if terminology is unfamiliar
- Use Party Mode to explore your brand from different perspectives

### For Consultants/Agencies (Express Mode)
- Have your client inputs ready before starting
- Use Template Loading for repeat client configurations
- Run Brand Health Check to quickly identify gaps
- Export all 4 outputs for client delivery packages

### For In-House Marketers (Hybrid Mode)
- Gather existing brand materials before starting
- Use Advanced Elicitation to refine brand articulation
- Leverage Party Mode for multi-stakeholder validation
- Generate multiple output formats for different internal audiences

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the Core** - The workflow starts with values and purpose (the foundation), then builds outward
2. **Embrace the Spiral** - If validation fails, looping back to refine is normal and expected
3. **Use the Tools** - Brainstorming, Advanced Elicitation, and Party Mode are there to help
4. **Pause and Resume** - The sidecar file lets you pause and continue across multiple sessions
5. **Validate Early** - The spiral validation step catches misalignment before output generation

## Post-Creation Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test the Workflow:** Run it with a sample brand to ensure it works as expected
2. **Review All Outputs:** Open each generated file to verify formatting
3. **Customize if Needed:** Modify data files (archetypes, colors, tones) for your industry

### Optional Enhancements

- Add industry-specific brand archetype examples
- Expand color psychology CSV with trend data
- Create brand example templates for common verticals
- Add brand audit workflow for existing brands

### For Team Deployment

- Share this completion summary with team members
- Create user documentation for your specific use case
- Establish best practices for when to use each user mode
- Set up output file storage conventions

## Compliance Check Recommendation

**IMPORTANT:** Run the BMAD compliance check in a NEW context to validate your workflow meets all template standards:

1. **Start a new Claude conversation** (fresh context)
2. **Use this command:** `/bmad:bmm:workflows:workflow-compliance-check`
3. **Provide the path:** `{project-root}/_bmad\marketing-agent-team\custom\src\workflows\brand-setup\workflow.md`
4. **Follow the validation process** to identify and fix any violations
