**Status**: Placeholder (Full workflow to be created in Step 7)

## Purpose

RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) workflow that captures user feedback to continuously improve content generation quality.

## Key Features

- Feedback collection from content approval/rejection
- Pattern recognition across feedback
- Learning data persistence
- Content generation calibration
- Brand voice refinement over time

## Workflow Plan

1. **Content Review** - User reviews generated content
2. **Feedback Capture** - Approve/reject/refine with specific feedback
3. **Pattern Extraction** - Identify learning patterns from feedback
4. **Learning Record** - Save to persistent learning data
5. **System Calibration** - Update content generation preferences
6. **Quality Improvement** - Apply learning to future generation

## Integration Points

- Receives feedback from Content Creation Agent
- Managed by Analytics Agent's learning analysis
- Stores learning data for cross-agent improvement
- Continuously improves all content generation quality
